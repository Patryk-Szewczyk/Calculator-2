# Calculator-2
Calculator 2 is my "specific" Calculator to calculate stricte Math issues, such like: lowest common multiple (LCM), greatest common measure (GCM), integer number factorization and solving math logic (sentences and tautologies). This project I made on studies as discrete mathemetic's final project.
